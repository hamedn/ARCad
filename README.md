# ARCad
3D Augmented Reality CAD Editor

ARCad is an augmented reality CAD editor that allows anyone to quickly design simple 3D models. The users positions vertices in 3D space and connects them to create meshes, allowing users without CAD experience to quickly communicate their 3D ideas.

ARCad was developed for 3D UIs and Augmented Reality (COMS 4172) at Columbia University

Directory Overview: The code/models/etc. are contained in the Assignment_3 folder of the project. Within that folder, Images contains all the sprites, Models contains all the models, and Scripts contains all the code. Poly2Mesh.cs is a library in Scripts that we used for procedural mesh generation.
